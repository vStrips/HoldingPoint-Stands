<h3><b>How to create a holding point layout</b></h3>

<ul>
  <li>Create a new folder structure on your local PC(L-I-RF)</li>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/jmoQpRN.png">
  <li>Find an up-to-date .BGL file. </li>
  <li>Open BGL file in ADE</li>
  <li>Remove all excessive detail</li>
  <li>Save the new .bgl file as image and export to new folder (LIRF.jpg)</li>
  <li>Open saved image in photoshop or similar software.</li>
  <li>Add holding point images onto ground layout. (Many are pre-made in the ‘HP’ folder. You will also find a .psd ‘blank’ file should you need to add any more. Sizes are 39x39 or 20x20)</li>
  <li>Remember that the holding points need to be ‘obvious’ enough to be used with a touch screen monitor and should not be too small or too close together.</li>
  <li>When all holding points added, save the .psd file to the folder structure above as well as the exported image as .jpg.</li>
  <li>Right click on the exported image and ‘open with’, locate the installed SHPIndexer. </li>
  <li>Here you will map the coordinates on the image for each holding point.</li>
  <li>Click on the holding point, type the label at the bottom and press ‘add’.</li>
  <li>When all points are added, save and close.</li>
  <li>A file RF.txt / LIRF.txt will be added to the folder directory above. </li>
  <li>When complete, zip contents of the parent folder and email to <a href="mailto:datasubmission@vstrips.co.uk?subject=Data Submission">datasubmission@vstrips.co.uk</a> for approval.</li>
